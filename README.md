Face detection and Mask detection
{Problem Statement}
Develop AI models to detect face and identify whether the person is wearing a
mask or not.
Please follow following phases for development:\\
Phase 1\\
1. Develop an AI model to detect faces.
2. You can select any suitable standard dataset based on your understanding of
the problem statement mentioned above.
3. You can select any suitable AI model for face detection based on your
understanding of the problem statement mentioned above.
4. You can select any suitable evaluation metrics and test dataset for face
detection based on your understanding of the problem statement mentioned
above.
5. Generate output videos of faces detected on above test videos after
inference from your AI model.\\
Phase 2\\
1. Continuing with above developments in phase 1, augment an AI model to
detect mask/no mask along with the phase1 AI model to detect faces.
2. You can select any suitable standard dataset based on your understanding of
the problem statement mentioned above.
3. You can select any suitable AI model for mask detection based on your
understanding of the problem statement mentioned above.
4. You can select any suitable evaluation metrics and test dataset for mask
detection based on your understanding of the problem statement mentioned
above.
5. Generate output videos showing box on each detected face and indicate
green color of box for mask and red for no mask on above test videos after
inference from your AI model.
Please prepare documentation and upload your above work on a github
repository.


Objective is to check the performance in following test videos\\
